Three students including myself took on the challenge. Recognising the existing design's lack of visual appeal for art students, we focused on incorporating updated copy into layouts that were both informative and visually engaging. My approach involved crafting each spread with a unique design, ensuring users remained stimulated and actively interacted with the content, thus celebrating the school's vibrant creative spirit. ">
